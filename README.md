CoShell

CoShell is a terminal-based collaboration toolbox that means Cooperating in Shell.

The goal is to enable collaboration within the terminal environment without relying on external GUI programs when collaborating.

Functions

1. To-Do-List Management

You can record a list of tasks that team members need to do.

The list window is fixed on the left box of CoShell, and you can add, delete, and modify the list. You can also check the box next to the list to indicate whether it has already been completed or is in progress.

2. Chat

Team members can chat in real time. You can enter the server port number and set a nickname to distinguish between members. You can update the list in To-Do-List in real time using commands such as /add and /del while chatting with members in real time.

3. QR Code Generate

You can distribute data as QR in conference rooms, study rooms, etc. without running a chat or file server, so there is no cumbersome upload or download process. QR code To create, enter the absolute path of Linux. However, the QR size is determined by the size of the data, so you must maximize the terminal and use this function. The maximum data that the QR can contain is 2.9KB, but the QR code may be too large and may be cut off in the Linux window depending on the device, so it was limited to 700KB.

4. Time Setting

When collaborating, you can fix the current Local time zone and set up to 2 world time zones, considering members in different time zones. When you press function 4, the world time zones that can be changed will appear, and you can enter the index of the time zone to be changed (index 1, 2 in order of time zones under Local) and enter the index of the time to be changed. Initially, USA ET and UK GMT are set. For example, if you want to change the USA ET time zone to JP JST, enter "1 9" to change it.

When you want to exit, you can press exit to exit CoShell.
