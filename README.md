CoShell

CoShell (short for Cooperating in Shell) is a terminal‐based collaboration toolbox that lets teams work together entirely within a shell environment—no external GUI tools required.

Key Features

To Do List Management
Track and manage tasks for your team.
A persistent “List” panel on the left lets you add, delete, and edit items.
Mark tasks as complete or in‐progress with a simple checkbox.

Chat
Real‐time messaging for your team.
Connect by entering the server’s port number and choosing a nickname to distinguish participants.
Use commands like /add and /del during chat to update the To Do list on the fly.

QR Code Generation
Instantly distribute data via QR codes—no need for file uploads or a chat/file server.
Simply enter an absolute Linux path to generate a QR code.
Terminal must be maximized to accommodate the QR display.
